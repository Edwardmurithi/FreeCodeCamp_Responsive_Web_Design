            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the 
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, 
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, 
            control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for 
            a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for 
            example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                 to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, 
                 client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an 
                 HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, 
                 and page navigation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects 
                relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side 
                extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide 
                continuity of information from one invocation to another of the 
                application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
              </p>

          </ul>

      Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java")

      The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each)

      The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)

      The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each)

      You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"

      The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation

      Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section

      The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar

      Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")

      When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)

      On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user

       Your technical documentation should use at least one media query
